## The Mission
The health care company "skinCare" hire you as a freelance data scientist for a short mission.
As they pay you an incredible amount of money you accept. Here is the mail you receive:

```
from: sales.skincare.be@gmail.com
to:   projects@becode.org

Hi,

At skinCare we have more and more demands from companies for a tool that would be able to detect moles that need to be handle by doctors.

You mission, if you accept it, would be to do an AI that can detect when the mole is dangerous. To be able to use your AI, we want you to create a simple web page where the user could upload a picture of the mole and see the result.

We don't have a web dev department in our company you will need to handle the UI as well, we don't care about having something amazing on the design side, we just want a proof of concept to show our client that the product has potential. You are free in the technology you want to use.

You will also need to put your application on the internet so we can use it. Our IT department asks you to use "Docker" so they can "deploy" it on their own afterward without your help. I guess you know what does it mean.

You will find attached to this email the data you need.

If you have any question, feel free to reply to this mail or to send a mail to our department at the email address: sales.skincare.be@gmail.com

Good luck,
skinCare sales team

Analyze the customer's request.
The dataset provided by the client is in the `attached_file` folder.

### Must-have feature
* Understand the requirements from the client.
* Create a product that answers to their needs.

### Tips
* To have a good accuracy you will need to preprocess your images. OpenCV is amazing for that.
* To download the dataset, you will need `git lfs`. check [their documentation](https://git-lfs.github.com) for more information.

### Presentation
Present your product in front of the group.
* You have to make a nice presentation **with a professional design**.
* You have **10 minutes** to present (without Q&A). **You can't use more time**, **you can't use less time**.
* **Everyone has to talk** during the presentation.
* You **CAN'T show code or jupyter notebook** during the presentation.
* Remember, you present a SaaS (**S**oftware **A**s **A** **S**ervice) present it like it is.


## Deliverables
1. Pimp up the readme file:
    * What, Why, When, How, Who.

    * Pending things to do
2. Present your results in front of the group in **10mins max**.
