    "## Mission objectives \n",
    "- Be able interact with Twitter's API \n",
    "- Be able create a sentiment analysis model\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Mission\n",
    "You just got an internship at Netflix. As a first task, they ask you to analyze people's reaction to their new show \"The Queen's Gambit\" on Twitter.\n",
    "They are only interested in English speaker's reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "* You scrapped at least 10000 tweets in English containing the hashtag `#queengambit`\n",
    "* You predicted an overall sentiment out of all those tweets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Scrap the **10000 most recent English tweets** with the hashtag: `#queengambit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the Twitter API (recommended) or do it with the classical scrapping methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "Preprocess the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Find a sentiment analysis dataset that matches your use-case.\n",
    "Then, create a sentiment analysis model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Evaluate your model\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure your model predicts right.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 5: Predict the overall sentiment\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that your model is ready, extract the general sentiment out of your scrapped data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 6: double check\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly check a few tweets to verify that your model predicts the right sentiment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 7: presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Prepare a presentation with all the insights that you have gathered about the show's reactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bonus: Make an API\n",
    "\n",
    "- Make an API that accepts a hashtag in the route `/predict`\n",
    "- Run the complete pipeline to predict the sentiment out of your hashtag\n",
    "- Wrap the API in a Docker container\n",
    "- Deploy it on Heroku\n",
