    "## Mission objectives \n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand and use natural language generation.\n",
    "- Combining Computer vision and NLP\n",
    "- Use transfer learning.\n",

    "## The Mission\n",
    "\n",
    "This time you'll have to work for Facebook! Facebook wants to develop a deep learning model that allows you to generate a text description from a photo. This is a big technical challenge because you have to combine your computer vision and NLP skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Must-have features\n",
    "\n",
    "Your challenge will be to create descriptions that come closest to what a human could write. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is to say, your description should be a sentence and not just key words like \"Dog, running, garden\" but rather \"A dog running in a garden\".\n",
    "\n",
    "![caption generation](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-RgNlhmSJvgU/Vna0V_GNGXI/AAAAAAAAACw/tjYqwuGHekM/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2015-12-20%2Bat%2B08.59.26.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Nice-to-have features\n",
    "- Create an API\n",
    "- Use Docker\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "1. Publish your source code on the GitHub repository.\n",
    "2. Pimp up the README file:\n",
    "   - Description\n",
    "   - Installation\n",
    "   - Usage\n",
    "   - (Visuals)\n",
    "   - (Contributors)\n",
    "   - (Timeline)\n",
    "   - (Personal situation)\n",
    "3. Publish the link to the \"live\" version on your startup's Discord channel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps\n",
    "1. #### Image and Caption Dataset\n",
    "The dataset has a pre-defined training dataset (6,000 images), development dataset (1,000 images), and test dataset (1,000 images)\n",
    "    - [Download Flickr8k_dataset.zip (1 gb)](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_Dataset.zip)\n",
    "    - [Download Flickr8k_text.zip (2,2 mb)](https://github.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/releases/download/Flickr8k/Flickr8k_text.zip)\n",
    "2. #### Prepare image data\n",
    "As usual, it is necessary to prepare your images. (Put all the images at the right size, etc...)\n",
    "3. #### Prepare text data\n",
    "The dataset contains multiple descriptions for each photograph and the text of the descriptions requires some minimal cleaning.\n",
    "4. #### Develop the deep learning model\n",
    "Use a pre-formatted model to interpret image content and generate text. \n",
    "Take a look at Keras, Bert, OpenCV... You can choose your favorite tools.\n",
    "5. #### Evaluate Model\n",
    "Use the test and validation dataset to evaluate your model.  \n",
    "[BLEU scores are used in text translation for evaluating translated text against one or more reference translations.](https://ariepratama.github.io/Introduction-to-BLEU-in-python/)!\n",
    "6. #### Generate new captions\n",
    "Use images taken at random on the net to generate new descriptions. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation criterias\n",
    "1. Get a BLUE score of 0.50.\n",
    "1. Use only pre-trained models.\n",
    "\n",
