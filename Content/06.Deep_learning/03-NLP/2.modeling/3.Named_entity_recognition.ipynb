    "# Named entity recognition (N.E.R.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Named entity recognition is a NLP technique to extract specific entities from a document.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could, for example, extract all the addresses or all the prices or both at the same time! It should be easy to do for the model as the format will almost always be the same (there are exceptions of course).\n",
    "    * All the addresses are going to contain a street name, a number, a zip code, a city and a country.\n",
    "    * All the prices are going to be number with a money symbol before or after it.\n",
    "    * All the names are going to start with an uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are in this case, even if putting AI in the title of you project is cool, you should ask yourself if a regular expression (RegEx) is not easier and better. \n",
    "\n",
    "But you could also want to only extract prices **without** taxes, or only the address of the receiver in letters. In this case, you want a specific entity, and it's way harder to do with RegEx. That's where NER is useful."

    "[SpaCy](https://spacy.io/) gives you a set of pre-trained models in several languages. However, they are very general models, so general that if you have a use-case a little bit specific, it will probably not be enough. **But** if you want to do a demo or do a proof of concept, it will be one of the best way to go."
