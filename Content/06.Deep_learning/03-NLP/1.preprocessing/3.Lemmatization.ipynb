    "As we saw in the previous chapter, we can explain to the machine which words are similar but also how different there are. But sometimes you don't want to catch the difference between those words, let's take an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can building a model to classify books, for that you want to take a list of the most recurrent words in each category. You have books about cooking and books about cars.\n",
    "You don't really want to make a distinction between `wheel` and `wheels` or between `foot` and `feet` for example. To fix that, we will apply **lemmatization** which will put each word in its simplest variation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Still confused?\n",
    "Let's see how it works in a practical case.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, read [this article](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/lemmatization-examples-python/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, try to apply what you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro tips:** Most lemmatizers only work with a single word and not on sentences. Think about tokenizing your sentence first.\n",
