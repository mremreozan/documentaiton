In this section, you will find informations about:

 * [Tokenization](./1.tokenization.ipynb)
 * [Embeddings](./2.word_embedding.ipynb)
 * [Lemmatization](./3.Lemmatization.ipynb)
 * [tagging and chunking](./4.tagging_and_chunking.ipynb)
 * [Html tags](./5.html_tags.ipynb)
 * [Text formatting](./6.text_formatting.ipynb)
 * [Stop words](./7.stop_words.ipynb)

But of course, you will not need all of these steps each time, it depend on your data and  on what you want to do with it.

We will see what we need depending on what we want to do later. But first let's undersand what are all these steps and why we would want to apply them.

**Disclaimer:** Depening on the task you will need to perform several others preprocessing steps can be used. Make sure to explore more options if you want to get more accuracy.
